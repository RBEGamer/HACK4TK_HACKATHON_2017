# IDEA
This is the repo for the hack4tk 2017 hackathon from the team Aixtreme. 
The basic idea is a PLC monitoring system with an attached TextToSpeachSystem to alert the technicans via a headset.
The system is completly dynamicly and provied an easy installation. The central part of the system is the WebApp to set/unset sensor alarms. The PLC Systems are grouped in Companies/Machines on a earthmap you can see all facilities with registered sensors.
The WebApp provides a "realtime" monitoring via graphs too. The TTS System is a simple python script so it can executed on much embedded systems like a RPI.
